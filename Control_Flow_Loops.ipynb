    "#### Control Flow\n",
    "First and foremost, what is control flow? Well, in simple terms it is the order in which certain operations are executed at runtime based on a condition. In programming, if we want to do a specific task or operation, we need to do simple smaller steps. These steps can for example include decision making or repetition of a task for a given number of times. Control Flow is one of the most important topics related to programming, and it certainly differs a useful from a useless code. Everywhere from simple data exploration to “State-of-the-Art” Neural Networks, we deal with Control Flow of some kind. Control flow contains statement or condition and body or block of the loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the programming languages like C, C++ and Java use braces {} to define a block of code, Python, however, uses indentation. A code block (body of a loop) starts with indentation and ends with the first unintended line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block. Generally, four white spaces are used for indentation and are preferred over tabs.The indentation makes the code look neat and clean. Indentation can be ignored in line continuation, but it’s always a good idea to indent. It makes the code more readable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The flow control statements can be divided into following three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tConditional statements\n",
    "2.\tIterative statements\n",
    "3.\tTransfer statements \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in keywords for conditional logic, loops, and other standard control flow concepts found in other programming languages.\n",
